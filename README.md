# Password Plug
If you need a password I gotchu!

## Introduction

Creating a working password generator helped me gain more experience and exposure to using "conditions", "functions" along with a better understanding of how "calling" a "function" works.   Although this is still alot of information to take in this class, im still motivated to push myself to learn more with weekly challenges like these.
